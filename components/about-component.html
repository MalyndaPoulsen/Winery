				<hr>
				<p class="text-center lead module-subtitle">Plumb Cellars was created by a group of friends that share a love and passion for good wine. In the fall of 2006, we
				 created our first vintage of the Damn Straight red wine blend. <br>While we planted our first
					vineyard, our cofounder, a builder by trade, insisted that all the rows be straight and all the vineyard stakes plumb.
					This deep desire for precision and correctness, brought us to choose the name, Plumb. A wine made
					with perfectionâ€”a fine, straight wine.</p>

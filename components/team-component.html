                       <p>Crandall Kyle's introduction to wine started in 1995 with a harvest job at L'Ecole No 41. It was such a fun and interesting job, in an industry whose product he enjoyed so much, that his harvest job lasted for 6 more years.

An accountant by trade, he left there to go work at a public accounting firm, but missed being involved with wine. So when an opportunity to make some garage wine came in 2002, he jumped on board. In an effort to always make better wine, he decided to take a small-lot winemaking course in 2003 from Stan Clarke, a highly respected viticulturist. In this class were several friends of his, and he decided to consolidate their carboy's and make it a joint venture. This venture grew into something bigger and bigger and now has a nameâ€¦Plumb Cellars.</p></div>
